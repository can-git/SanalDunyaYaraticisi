City Streets Checkerboard is Checkerboard like city terrain and roads system 
for urban environment projects. 

Package contains 39 connectable square terrain pieces. 

Prefab scene presents all 39 available pieces stacked in groups 
that connect to each other in most logical manner. 
Align pieces by the corner (with V key) and rotate by 90 (or 180 or 270) 
degrees if needed as they rotate around the center. 
Demo scene present all the prefabs mentioned above 
plus an example of a small area of a closed city terrain composed of them. 
Not every piece connects to the rest but if you follow a simple rule 
of starting with a type of road you want lets say a two lane 
than you connect two lane crossing and continue accordingly. 
This system is designed to help you create reasonably complex road system for your 
city environment ad logically close every road network you started. 
When compiling city structure perhaps it is reasonable to start with more compact 
network in traditional center (one lane + two lane roads) and construct 
highways in surroundings, for a metropolis like center use four lane cross-road segments. 
Demo scene provides you with the combinations above. 
This package does not contain any automated system for terrain construction. 
It is purely and simply - duplicate - move - align - rotate. 
However each square dimensions are 30 by 30 meters so you will be able to assemble quite a vast area rather quickly.
